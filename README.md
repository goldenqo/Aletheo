From Greek it's the Bringer of truth from God, or simply God of Truth. Most of the development is now in private repo/background for a bit while

Because of EIP-3561 specifically designed for Aletheo, refactoring and optimization is not critical as of now, so the recent version of Aletheo smart contracts does not look as nice, as it was before.

Next version of whitepaper soon, latest is [0.6](https://github.com/SamPorter1984/Aletheo/blob/main/papers/Aletheo%20Whitepaper%200.6.pdf) and has a couple of errors in design.

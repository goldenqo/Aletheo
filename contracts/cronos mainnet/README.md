## Zero Trust Period Set
Zero trust periods were set to 475200 blocks(approximately a month in cronos blocks) for each EIP-3561 proxy, which means that proposed logic will become active only after a month(instant malicious upgrades are impossible)

## EIP-3561 proxy locks
All EIP-3561 proxies were locked up to block https://cronoscan.com/block/countdown/9900000 which means that proposing an upgrade will be possible only after block 9900000, and zero trust period starts only then. Basically contracts are non upgradeable for a year.

**WARNING: SECURITY OF THIS EXTENSION IS STILL NOT A PRIORITY.** Do not store any funds in this wallet.

If you have successfully performed above steps, now you can post in threads which have "Aletheo" in topic and receive mainnet tokens as rewards.

The extension works in the background, you can just post as you post normally.
Basic rules for posting:

1. Only posts with unique text count.
2. Can't post with one address more often than roughly every minute.
3. "Aletheo" in the topic of op-post is not case-sensitive.
4. Green text is ignored by the oracle, as well as reply links like >>. So a reply with an image will be considered an empty post and won't be registered.
5. Op posts are never registered, so never get paid. So Aletheo won't cause wipe.
6. You have to be human to post in Aletheo threads. Botting, especially blatant botting will get you nowhere.

**HOW TO INSTALL THIS EXTENSION ON ANDROID:**

1. allow installs from unknown sources
2. go here: https://m.apkpure.com/waterfox-web-browser-open-free-and-private/org.waterfoxproject.waterfox and install waterfox
3. then with waterfox you can install any version of the extension. with waterfox, if you click "download file" instead of acting like a virgin firefox, waterfox will actually allow you to install the extension. however, -lite version is strongly recommended for mobile since apparently waterfox mobile container does not allocate enough resources for ethers js

lite version does not work at all until you specify rewards address(any public ethereum address you own and trust it's security). So after installing lite version, click on the extension in waterfox, it will open aletheo wallet popup, enter your address there either by copypasting somehow or MANUALLY(imagine). The downside of using lite version is that when eventually humanness stat will be added and measured, a weak incentive to ruin somebody' else humanness exists. Right now lite version does not have this vulnerability, because no humanness stats yet added.

                <h4>How to get paid for shitposting on twitter?</h4>
                Authorization is non-invasive, <i style="color:green;">which means that you don't have to expose your twitter password in any way to any sort of Aletheo software.</i><br>
                What you have to do is to click on "options/faq" link, enter your twitter profile link in the form and a unique message, click authorize button and then tweet that unique message from any device, from a phone or whatever, addon is not required to tweet. Important part is that you must first enter unique message into addon form, only then tweet. In about an hour or earlier oracle will check your account to witness that unique message. Authorization is indefinite. Absolute lunatics can re-authorize every two seconds if required. You don't have to mention Aletheo in your authorization tweet.<br>
                Same thread system as on imageboards as of now is supported: anybody can create a thread, except there is no limit of how many threads can exist at the same time. A thread must contain <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23aletheo&src=typed_query&f=live">#aletheo</a> to be eligible for paid shitposting. In the thread posting is bounded only by posters imagination.<br>
                <h5 style="font-size:11px">How much does posting on twitter cost today:</h5>
                Base posting is 5x cheaper than on biz. No captcha, no spooky addons, can be chatting and phoneposting easily about most "cancerous" topics and simply everyday activity chat. But here are some key differences which will be also introduced on other platforms with nicknames:<br>
                1. Humanness of the op-post matters. Every poster' pay in a thread relies on humanness of the op-post and after that on personal humanness modifier. Most human posters will gain engagement and it basically makes humanness fundamentally valuable before let token is traded.<br>
                2. Amount of likes and retweets of the op-post matters. Most engaged tweets have the highest pay for every poster in the thread.<br>
                Base pay for a post is 0.2, not 1. That if humanness is at default level 2. Same way as humanness modifier currently works, +-1 level means +-15% to base pay. Every like or retweet is +0.005<br>
                To make a twitter thread with default humanness as expensive as on 4chan biz, a thread would require say, 90 likes and 90 retweets. If twitter fails to gain poster base of which I am doubtful since it's easy phoneposting, incentives can be adjusted to find the balance between 4chan and twitter posting.<br>
                <h5 style="font-size:11px">Additional info:</h5>
                Threads do not have a bumplimit but they have a timelimit of 2 days. After expiration date no other tweets in the thread will be witnessed. Oracle does not check the threads every hour, it only registers users and op-posts every hour. Oracle reads whole threads only after expiration date is reached.<br>
                Immense humanness value which is being slowly rolled out does not exactly mean that a few most human posters will get all the engagement and other op-posts will stay completely deserted, fun stuff for bonus hunters is eventually coming. Bonus hunting will become more robust in general across imageboards too and while will be nerfed in next period, will still remain extremely profitable<br>
                On twitter only English is now supported. Or rather, only latin alphabet<br>
                <br>
                <h4>How to get paid for shitposting on imageboards?</h4><span style="color:red;">BEFORE POSTING: read the board rules and check the dropdown for what can you get reported, and avoid all that. /biz/ specifically is infested with paid shills and scams, and jannies do not hesitate to clean it up and they are not very tolerant. Usually rules loosen up a bit for posts inside a thread and are supposed to be followed the most strictly if you are creating a thread, however, this does not mean that your violations inside a thread will always stay unnoticed. Therefore for the most special individuals, /biz/ rules are literally copypasted in this section:<br>
                <span style="color:green;">>This board is for the discussion of topics related to business, economics, financial markets, securities, currencies (including cryptocurrencies), commodities, etc -- as well as topics relating to starting and running a business.<br>
                >Discussions of government policy must be strictly limited to economic policies (fiscal and monetary). Discussions of a political nature should be posted on >>>/pol/. Global Rule 3 is also obviously in effect.<br>
                >Note: /biz/ is NOT a place for ADVERTISING or SOLICITING. Do NOT use it to promote your business, ventures, or anything you may have an interest in. Anything that looks remotely like advertising or soliciting will be removed. Begging/asking (including tipping) for cryptocurrencies or asking for money/capital is also strictly forbidden.<br></span>
                Which means that an op-post definitely can't shill, an op-post can be either neutral or call it a scam.<br>
                <span style="color:green;">>Check the catalog before posting a new thread!<br>
                >Reply to existing threads about a topic instead of starting a new one. Mods will delete obvious duplicate threads and spam without notice.<br>
                >Begging or asking for 'free money'/crypto is strictly forbidden. Encouraging beggars, or posting any kind of 'free money' offer is also strictly forbidden.<br>
                >Submitting false or misclassified reports will result in a ban.<br></span>
                Also the list for what can a post be reported for, don't take it lightly, a part of biz reporters are economically incentivized to report as many threads dedicated to different tokens as possible, to keep the biz more related to their own bags.<br>
                <span style="color:green;">>This post violates a biz rule<br>
                >This post belongs on /pol/<br>>This post is begging for or offering free money<br>>Not work safe image on work safe board<br>>This post is off-topic<br>>This user is underage<br>
                >Trolling outside of /b/<br>>Racism outside of /b/<br>>Furry/guro/lolikon/shota porn outside of /b/<br>>Posting dubs/post number GET<br>
                >This post contains personal information (&quot;dox&quot;)<br>>This post contains a call to invasion (&quot;raid&quot;)<br>>This post is extremely low quality<br>
                >Spamming/flooding<br>>Intentionally evading spam/post filters<br>>This post appears to be an automated spambot<br>>This post is advertising or begging<br>
                >User impersonating 4chan Staff<br>>Avatar or signature use<br>>Pony content outside /mlp/<br>>Request thread (&#039;source&#039;, &#039;SAUCE&#039;, &#039;moar&#039;, etc)<br>
                >Announcing a report or &#039;sage&#039;<br>>This post violates United States law<br><br></span>
                And do not forget that posters are economically incentivized to report each other if report is valid.<br><br>
                </span>Post in the threads on 4chan /biz/ with 'Aletheo' in the subject<br>All posts on all boards that are not 4chan /biz/ are 10x cheaper than 4chan' /biz/ as of now due to low traffic and other considerations<br>As threads on /biz/ gain more and more posters, other places payment modifier will increase depending on their traffic.<br>If there is no thread on the board you want to post, create one<br>Creating a thread is never paid, because op is redacted<br>It's best if the thread topic contains not just 'aletheo'(lower-, uppercase does not matter) but also 'general' especially on /biz/ so that jannies won't clean it up<br>posts must be unique, you can completely derail the thread as long as a given board allows<br>you can fud or ignore Aletheo completely in Aletheo threads, you can shit on devs and architects, you can sage, you will still get paid the same amount for a post<br>on /biz you can only discuss /biz related topics<br>you can also post on aforementioned places in any thread except /smg/,/pmg/,/cmmg/,/gme/ threads in the subject and still get paid the same amount as long as your post contains 'aletheo'<br>oracle ignores green text, quote links, spaces, new lines, and after that is blind to everything but letters<br>oracle sees everything as lower case, so it's useless to aBuSe<br>
                <h4>Which imageboards and boards Aletheo supports?</h4>4channel.org: /biz/, /pol/, /b/, /x/, /g/<br>2ch.hk: /cc/, /po/, /int/, /b/, /wrk/, /d/<br>

                <h4>How rewards for posters are calculated?</h4>
                An amount LET is being divided between all posters every period according to fixed emission,<br>Current period is bi-weekly, rewards are assumed to be close to ~14,5k LET.<br>First period of the month starts from 1 day of the month midnight utc and ending on day 15 of the month 23:59:59 pm by UTC(Greenwich)<br>Second period starts after that and lasts up to the last day of the month 23:59:59 pm by UTC(Greenwich)<br>The less post in a period - the more tokens each posts costs.<br>Starting from the website modifier, like 4chan is being paid 10x more than any other imageboard as of now, then comes humanness modifier for every poster to compute how exactly rewards will be divided.
                <h4>What is humanness?</h4>
                Humanness level is subjective and attempts to measure how much of a bot/AI particular poster is. Current humanness levels are the most basic and mild in penalties and bonuses.<br>
                All new posters start with base humanness of 2.<br>It can be decreased due to consistent low-effort spam<br>If humanness is reduced to 1, poster earns 15% less rewards than level 2 humanness<br>If humanness is reduced to 0, poster earns 30% less rewards than level 2 humanness<br>Humanness level 3 is granted for good sense of humor and interesting and/or valuable posting and gives +15% rewards for every post.<br>Humanness is different for different languages, and currently exists only for English, in all other languages posts are so far get paid equally<br>Humanness is currently mild, since fundamental value of a bump on /biz/ is still high as there are not enough posters, but with time and established userbase the metric will become more and more complex<br>
                <h4>So who are the architects?</h4>
                It's an IQ test. Architects will be chosen out of most active human posters and will stay in their position indefinitely as long as they do they their job right. They vote for posters' humanness, not for each post of a poster, but for a history of posts a poster has. They will determine the pay. All architects have 1 vote, dev also has 1 vote. The more architects will be added, the more complex humanness will become. An architect must be human and must accumulate some bags with posting. Fudding or shilling is not what determines humanness. Top 1 metric is sense of humor, 0 cringe, then in-depth discussion about anything not political(at least 90% bots are probably political), etc, etc.
                <h4>When my humanness will be increased?</h4>
                You need to accumulate posting history for this, about 100 posts will probably be enough.
                <h4>Where can I see how many of my posts were witnessed and how much I will get paid?</h4>
                For current period:<br>to see the threads and witnessed posts: <a href="https://aletheo.net/w.json">https://aletheo.net/w.json</a><br>to see the number of posts by every poster and at the end of the period amount of LET paid: <a href="https://aletheo.net/p.json">https://aletheo.net/p.json</a><br>to see twitter witnessed posts: <a href="https://aletheo.net/twitterWitnessed.json">https://aletheo.net/twitterWitnessed.json</a><br>These results are being updated once an hour, so you won't see witnessed posts or updated post count immediately. For twitter only authorization and thread op-post tracking is hourly, posts inside a thread are being observed only after the thread reaches the timelimit of 2 days.<br>Previous periods:<br><a href="https://aletheo.net/w-2021-8-1.json">https://aletheo.net/w-2021-8-1.json</a><br><a href="https://aletheo.net/p-2021-8-1.json">https://aletheo.net/p-2021-8-1.json</a><br><a href="https://aletheo.net/w-genesis.json">https://aletheo.net/w-genesis.json</a><br><a href="https://aletheo.net/p-genesis.json">https://aletheo.net/p-genesis.json</a><br>On 4chan in every thread at the bottom of the page you can find button "get poster addresses", which reveals all witnessed posts and poster addresses
                <h4>What is post bonus?</h4>
                Currently on 4chan your post will count as 2, if the last post in Aletheo thread was earlier than 15 minutes ago, and counts +1 for every 15 minutes more. Bonus hunting seems to be an entertaining activity for some posters, therefore stay tuned for updates in that specific functionality. However in September it will get nerfed to +0.3 of a post per every 15 minutes
                <h4>So what's the make it stack?</h4>
                Unironically, for posters:<br>Suicide stack 25 LET<br>Make it stack 250 LET<br>Fuck you money stack 2500 LET<br>For founders:<br>Suicide stack 0.025 ETH<br>Make it stack 0.25 ETH<br>

                <div><h4>How to get paid for shitposting?</h4><span style="color:red;">BEFORE POSTING: read the board rules and check the dropdown for what can you get reported, and avoid all that. /biz/ specifically is infested with paid shills and scams, and jannies do not hesitate to clean it up and they are not very tolerant. Usually rules loosen up a bit for posts inside a thread and are supposed to be followed the most strictly if you are creating a thread, however, this does not mean that your violations inside a thread will always stay unnoticed. Therefore for the most special individuals, /biz/ rules are literally copypasted in this section:<br>
                <span style="color:green;">>This board is for the discussion of topics related to business, economics, financial markets, securities, currencies (including cryptocurrencies), commodities, etc -- as well as topics relating to starting and running a business.<br>
                >Discussions of government policy must be strictly limited to economic policies (fiscal and monetary). Discussions of a political nature should be posted on >>>/pol/. Global Rule 3 is also obviously in effect.<br>
                >Note: /biz/ is NOT a place for ADVERTISING or SOLICITING. Do NOT use it to promote your business, ventures, or anything you may have an interest in. Anything that looks remotely like advertising or soliciting will be removed. Begging/asking (including tipping) for cryptocurrencies or asking for money/capital is also strictly forbidden.<br></span>
                Which means that an op-post definitely can't shill, an op-post can be either neutral or call it a scam.<br>
                <span style="color:green;">>Check the catalog before posting a new thread!<br>
                >Reply to existing threads about a topic instead of starting a new one. Mods will delete obvious duplicate threads and spam without notice.<br>
                >Begging or asking for 'free money'/crypto is strictly forbidden. Encouraging beggars, or posting any kind of 'free money' offer is also strictly forbidden.<br>
                >Submitting false or misclassified reports will result in a ban.<br></span>
                Also the list for what can a post be reported for, don't take it lightly, a part of biz reporters are economically incentivized to report as many threads dedicated to different tokens as possible, to keep the biz more related to their own bags.<br>
                <span style="color:green;">>This post violates a biz rule<br>
                >This post belongs on /pol/<br>>This post is begging for or offering free money<br>>Not work safe image on work safe board<br>>This post is off-topic<br>>This user is underage<br>
                >Trolling outside of /b/<br>>Racism outside of /b/<br>>Furry/guro/lolikon/shota porn outside of /b/<br>>Posting dubs/post number GET<br>
                >This post contains personal information (&quot;dox&quot;)<br>>This post contains a call to invasion (&quot;raid&quot;)<br>>This post is extremely low quality<br>
                >Spamming/flooding<br>>Intentionally evading spam/post filters<br>>This post appears to be an automated spambot<br>>This post is advertising or begging<br>
                >User impersonating 4chan Staff<br>>Avatar or signature use<br>>Pony content outside /mlp/<br>>Request thread (&#039;source&#039;, &#039;SAUCE&#039;, &#039;moar&#039;, etc)<br>
                >Announcing a report or &#039;sage&#039;<br>>This post violates United States law<br><br></span>
                And do not forget that posters are economically incentivized to report each other if report is valid.<br><br>
                </span>Post in the threads on 4chan /biz/ with 'Aletheo' in the subject<br>All posts on all boards that are not 4chan /biz/ are 10x cheaper than 4chan' /biz/ as of now due to low traffic and other considerations<br>As threads on /biz/ gain more and more posters, other places payment modifier will increase depending on their traffic.<br>If there is no thread on the board you want to post, create one<br>Creating a thread is never paid, because op is redacted<br>It's best if the thread topic contains not just 'aletheo'(lower-, uppercase does not matter) but also 'general' especially on /biz/ so that jannies won't clean it up<br>posts must be unique, you can completely derail the thread as long as a given board allows<br>you can fud or ignore Aletheo completely in Aletheo threads, you can shit on devs and architects, you can sage, you will still get paid the same amount for a post<br>on /biz you can only discuss /biz related topics<br>you can also post on aforementioned places in any thread except threads containing word 'general' in the subject(so not in other generals besides Aletheo General) and still get paid the same amount as long as your post contains 'aletheo'<br>oracle ignores green text, quote links, spaces, new lines, and after that is blind to everything but letters<br>oracle sees everything as lower case, so it's useless to aBuSe<br>
                <h4>Which imageboards and boards Aletheo supports?</h4>4channel.org: /biz/, /pol/, /b/, /x/, /g/<br>2ch.hk: /cc/, /po/, /int/, /b/, /wrk/, /d/<br>
                kohlchan.net: /ng/, /b/, /int/, /pol/, /kohl/<br>endchan.gg: /ausneets/, /imouto/, /librejp/, /rus/, /pol/, /b/, /kc/, /biz/, /g/<br>indiachan.com: /b/, /pol/, /dhan/, /g/<br>

                <h4>How rewards for posters are calculated?</h4>
                An amount LET is being divided between all posters every period according to fixed emission,<br>Current period is bi-weekly, rewards are assumed to be close to ~14,5k LET.<br>First period of the month starts from 1 day of the month midnight utc and ending on day 15 of the month 23:59:59 pm by UTC(Greenwich)<br>Second period starts after that and lasts up to the last day of the month 23:59:59 pm by UTC(Greenwich)<br>The less post in a period - the more tokens each posts costs.<br>Starting from the website modifier, like 4chan is being paid 10x more than any other imageboard as of now, then comes humanness modifier for every poster to compute how exactly rewards will be divided.
                <h4>What is humanness?</h4>
                Humanness level is subjective and attempts to measure how much of a bot/AI particular poster is. Current humanness levels are the most basic and mild in penalties and bonuses.<br>
                All new posters start with base humanness of 2.<br>It can be decreased due to consistent low-effort spam<br>If humanness is reduced to 1, poster earns 15% less rewards than level 2 humanness<br>If humanness is reduced to 0, poster earns 30% less rewards than level 2 humanness<br>Humanness level 3 is granted for good sense of humor and interesting and/or valuable posting and gives +15% rewards for every post.<br>Humanness is different for different languages, and currently exists only for English, in all other languages posts are so far get paid equally<br>Humanness is currently mild, since fundamental value of a bump on /biz/ is still high as there are not enough posters, but with time and established userbase the metric will become more and more complex and harsh<br>
                <h4>So who are the architects?</h4>
                It's an IQ test. Architects will be chosen out of most active human posters and will stay in their position indefinitely as long as they do they their job right. They vote for posters' humanness, not for each post of a poster, but for a history of posts a poster has. They will determine the pay. All architects have 1 vote, dev also has 1 vote. The more architects will be added, the more complex humanness will become. An architect must be human and must accumulate some bags with posting. Fudding or shilling is not what determines humanness. Top 1 metric is sense of humor, 0 cringe, then in-depth discussion about anything not political(at least 90% bots are probably political), etc, etc.
                <h4>So what's the make it stack?</h4>
                Unironically, for posters:<br>Suicide stack 25 LET<br>Make it stack 250 LET<br>Fuck you money stack 2500 LET<br>For founders:<br>Suicide stack 0.025 ETH<br>Make it stack 0.25 ETH<br>
                Fuck you money stack 2.5 ETH
